# Business-and-AI

Question 1: (6 points)
Problem statement
You work for a startup, and your CEO/founder thinks the next big thing is peer-to-peer car sharing.  She believes that with cars spending 90% of their life in a garage or parked on the street people will be interested in renting them to make some extra cash.  She wants you to investigate the idea and develop a proposal for a peer-to-peer car sharing application.  The proposal should include a recommendation for the design of the application, potential applications of AI, the value proposition, and the business model.
Deliverables
The goal of this problem is to better understand how you would approach data science/AI problems with as near to real-life situations as possible. As a deliverable, prepare 1 page document on the topic below. I recognize that you’re working with incomplete information, so I am looking for how you approach breaking down and solving for problems.
Prepare a 1 page write up describing your approach to developing your proposal to the CEO. The write up is not the proposal itself. It should include answers to below questions:
•	What questions would you have, who would you want to ask, and how would you go about trying to find an answer?
•	What do you need to learn and how would you approach learning what you need?
•	What assumptions are you making?
•	How would you measure success?
•	What risks are there in your plan and how would you manage that risk?
